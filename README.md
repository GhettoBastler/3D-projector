# 3D projector thingy

![](image.jpg)

For [December Adventures](https://eli.li/december-adventure) 2023 I decided to finally learn some C by making a 3D projector inspired by [moogle](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/moogle.html) and [pinhole](https://git.sr.ht/~bellinitte/pinhole).

The full log is available [here](https://ghettobastler.com/december_adventure_2023.html).

## Things I'd like to try

- Generate models from a separate input file
- Do triangle rasterisation

## Disclaimer

This is a learning project. I'm sharing it here for others to see, but I wouldn't recommend actually using it, as it is quite slow, buggy and resource hungry.
